# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the **latest commit on `staging`** receives security patches.  
Patches are fast-forwarded to `main` on the next release cycle.

| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `staging`        | ✅                            |
| `main`           | ✅ (via staging→main release) |
| Feature branches | ❌                            |
